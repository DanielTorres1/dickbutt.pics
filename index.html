            <h2>About Dick Butt</h2>
            <p>Dick Butt is an illustration of an anthropomorphic phallus with a pair of testicles and a penis
                protruding from its backside. Originally created by webcomic artist K.C. Green in 2006, the character
                has become one of the internet's most recognizable and enduring memes.</p>

            <p>The drawing is most commonly used in multi-pane image macros and animated GIFs where Dick Butt is
                revealed unexpectedly in the final frame, serving as a form of visual bait-and-switch or Rick Roll-style
                surprise. The character's absurd design and unexpected appearances have made it a beloved fixture of
                internet humor culture.</p>

            <div class="quote-block">
                "Dick Butt represents the internet's love for the absurd, the unexpected, and the hilariously juvenile.
                It's art, but not as we know it." - Internet Historians, probably

                        <h3>The Birth of Dick Butt</h3>
                        <p>Artist K.C. Green published a webcomic titled <span class="highlight">"Tree. You've Been Good
                                to Us"</span> as part of the <strong>Horribleville</strong> series. The comic featured
                            an artist who illustrates the Dick Butt character after being scolded for wasting tree
                            resources as a child.</p>
                        <p>This origin story gives Dick Butt a meta-textual quality - it's literally a character created
                            as a form of artistic rebellion against waste, which ironically became one of the internet's
                            most wastefully shared images.</p>
